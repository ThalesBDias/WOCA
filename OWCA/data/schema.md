# Regiment data schema (v1)

This document describes OWCA's source rules catalogs. It is separate from the public saved-regiment and saved-character contract in [`JSON_INTEROPERABILITY.md`](../../JSON_INTEROPERABILITY.md). The machine-readable save schemas are `owca_regiment_save.schema.json` and `owca_character_save.schema.json` in this directory.

The regiment root object provides `schema_version`, `content_version`, `budget`, `maximum_doctrines`, rule catalog dictionaries, `base_effects`, and `options`. Equipment definitions are owned separately by `equipment_catalog.json`.

Each option has:

```json
{
  "id": "stable_snake_case_id",
  "category": "home_world | commander | regiment_type | training_doctrine | equipment_doctrine",
  "name": "Display name",
  "cost": 0,
  "summary": "Short original summary",
  "effects": {},
  "choices": [],
  "requirements": { "all": [], "any": [] },
  "excludes": [],
  "source": { "book": "source_catalog_id", "page": 0 }
}
```

Supported effect keys are:

- `characteristics`: map of characteristic name to signed integer.
- `skills`: array of skill catalog IDs. Grants advance through Known, Trained (+10), Experienced (+20), and Veteran (+30), capped by the catalog's `maximum_rank`.
- `talents`: array of talent catalog IDs. Stackable talents keep a count. Each extra grant of a non-stackable starting Talent is converted to 100 bonus XP per character.
- `aptitudes`: array of Starting Aptitude names. Repeated names are de-duplicated in the regiment result.
- `special_rules`: array of `{ "name", "summary" }` objects.
- `wounds`: signed integer.
- `equipment`: array of catalog references. Entries support `quantity`, `scope`, `slot`, `replace_slot`, and `merge` (`add`, `replace`, or `unique`).
- `equipment_adjustments`: adjusts only matching existing kit. It can target a catalog `tag` or the current main weapon's `ammunition_id`; Well-Provisioned uses both forms.
- `standard_kit_points_base`: overrides the normal 30-point additional kit pool before adding 2 points per unused Regiment Creation point.

A choice belongs to its parent option and contains `id`, `prompt`, `minimum`, `maximum`, optional `scope`, optional `unique_group`, and an `options` array. Every choice option has its own `id`, `label`, and `effects`. Choice IDs must be globally stable. `unique_group` prevents two choice fields from resolving to the same option, as used by Hive World's two distinct characteristic bonuses. Core options marked with an "or" use `scope: "per_character"`. The Regiment Creator lists those choices without resolving them; their definitions are copied into the regiment save so the Character Creator can answer them independently for every character.

`requirements.all` means every listed option ID must be selected. `requirements.any` means at least one listed option ID must be selected. `excludes` lists incompatible option IDs. These checks are symmetrical at calculation time even if only one side declares the exclusion.

The UI reads `selection_rules`; category limits and doctrine-slot participation are therefore data rather than widget logic.

## Equipment catalogue schema (v1)

`equipment_catalog.json` is the single immutable definition source used by regiment creation, character creation, the Armoury browser, exports, and future inventory consumers. Every item has a stable `id`, `name`, category, concise source information, and a printed source-page reference. Applicable records add weight, Availability, ammunition relationships, armour coverage, or a weapon `profile` containing class, Damage, Penetration, qualities, and ranged profile fields.

The catalogue does not store ownership, current ammunition, equipped state, or installed modifications. Those values describe a particular character's item instance and must not be written back into a shared definition. `equipment_catalog.schema.json` documents the machine-readable shape; `EquipmentDataRepository` additionally checks unique IDs, source references, weapon profile completeness, and ammunition cross-references at runtime.

## Character advancement data schema (v1)

`guardsman_advancements.json` keeps XP rules separate from Speciality starting packages. Its `costs` object contains three matrices: `characteristic`, `skill`, and `talent`. Each matrix has `two`, `one`, and `zero` arrays selected by the number of matching Aptitudes. Characteristic and Skill arrays have four sequential entries; Talent arrays have one entry for each of three tiers.

Every Characteristic or Skill entry provides a display `name`, exactly two `aptitudes`, an optional `recommended_for` array of Speciality IDs, and an optional `source`. Talent entries additionally provide `tier`, `prerequisites`, a concise original `summary`, and optional `repeatable` or `specialist` flags. A Talent that OWCA can price and explain but cannot safely add to the purchase ledger sets `purchase_supported` to `false` and supplies a player-facing `unsupported_reason`; the browser keeps the entry visible and disables its purchase action.

Supported prerequisite objects are:

- `characteristic`: requires a named Characteristic at `minimum`.
- `skill`: requires a Skill ID at `minimum_rank`, where 1 is Known and 2 is Trained (+10).
- `skill_any`: requires any Skill from an explicit `ids` array at `minimum_rank`.
- `talent`: requires one Talent ID.
- `talent_any`: requires any Talent from an explicit `ids` array.
- `talent_prefix`: requires any known Talent whose stable ID shares a prefix.
- `talent_prefix_count`: requires a minimum number of known Talents whose stable IDs share a prefix.
- `skill_prefix`: requires any known Skill specialisation whose stable ID shares a prefix.
- `aptitude`: requires one named Aptitude.
- `special`: records an implant, Psy Rating, selected-skill rank, or other state not yet represented by the current character model. It remains unmet until a dedicated subsystem exposes that state explicitly.

Each prerequisite includes a short `label` for the UI. Full rule text is deliberately omitted. When an entry has no explicit source, `source_defaults` supplies the book and printed-page reference for its category.

Character state version 3 stores durable document identity, explicit workflow state, and purchases as an ordered array of stable IDs such as `characteristic:agility`, `skill:dodge`, or `talent:rapid_reload`. Replaying the list in order makes rank costs and prerequisite chains deterministic. Removing an earlier purchase causes every later purchase to be validated again. Version 1 and 2 character states remain migration inputs.
