# Only War Character Assistant v0.5.1 development

This module is a data-driven Godot 4 regiment and Guardsman creation assistant. Regiment creation includes every Core Rulebook option in the five supported categories: 8 Home Worlds, 9 Commanding Officers, 8 Regiment Types, 7 Training Doctrines, and 7 Equipment Doctrines. The current character-creation testing slice implements the five Core Guardsman Specialities: Heavy Gunner, Medic, Operator, Sergeant, and Weapon Specialist. Entries were checked against the supplied Only War Core Rulebook PDF; content files record printed book pages rather than PDF viewer indices.

## Run

Open the repository's `project.godot` in Godot 4 and run the project. The landing page separates regiment and character creation. The **13th Varanox** button fills the regiment acceptance example.

## Headless tests

On a fresh clone, let Godot build its generated global-class cache before running the script-based tests:

```text
godot --headless --editor --path . --quit
godot --headless --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/regiment_calculator_test.gd
godot --headless --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/character_calculator_test.gd
godot --headless --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/character_ui_layout_test.gd
godot --headless --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/character_creation_roller_test.gd
godot --headless --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/character_creation_roll_ui_test.gd
godot --headless --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/music_manager_test.gd
godot --headless --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/app_version_ui_test.gd
godot --headless --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/talent_browser_ui_test.gd
```

The character-sheet visual test needs a real renderer because Godot's Windows headless display driver is a dummy. It runs minimized and writes the example output to the path in `OWCA_PDF_OUTPUT`:

```text
godot --rendering-method gl_compatibility --path . --script res://OWCA/tests/character_sheet_export_test.gd
```

The Regiment Creator resolves only regiment-wide decisions. Choices marked `per_character` are listed as deferred benefits, do not prevent a regiment from being valid, and are not answered or stored as resolutions in the regiment file. The file carries a snapshot of those choice definitions for the future Character Creator.

Save files use a small versioned JSON envelope. Dossier export writes a readable plain-text summary that is suitable for printing from any editor. Rules are stored as short summaries with source/page pointers; consult the owned rulebook for complete wording.

Duplicate starting Skills advance from Known through Trained (+10), Experienced (+20), and Veteran (+30). Extra copies of a non-stackable starting Talent are reported as +100 XP per duplicate, following the Core Rulebook's regiment/character creation guidance.

The Guardsman Character Creator loads an `.owreg.json` regiment, accepts manually rolled base Characteristics, applies shared and individual modifiers, resolves regiment and Speciality choices, and calculates Wounds, Fate Points, Characteristic Bonuses, and Movement. It combines Skills, Talents, Aptitudes, rules, and equipment into one live summary and saves versioned `.owchar.json` character files. Physical and Discord dice remain fully supported.

Character creation also provides optional rolls for all nine base Characteristics (`2d10 + 20`), Wounds (`1d5`), and Fate (`1d10`). Every result shows its individual dice, remains manually editable, and requires confirmation before replacing an entered value. Manual edits clear the transient OWCA roll breakdown. Gameplay tests, attacks, damage, and ammunition use remain at the table.

The v0.5 development slice expands the ordered starting-XP ledger into a complete Core Talent browser. Its 124 entries and supported specialisations can be searched by name, brief effect, or prerequisite and filtered by Tier, Aptitude, prerequisite state, and purchase state. Every Talent displays its calculated Aptitude-based XP cost, short rules summary, prerequisites, availability reason, and Core Rulebook reference. Specialist, implant-dependent, Psy Rating, and variable Logistics-cost Talents remain visible but are disabled whenever OWCA cannot represent their required choice or state safely.

The character workflow is responsive down to a 960x650 minimum window. Advancement actions remain inside their cards, horizontal stage scrolling is disabled, and the live-summary column automatically hides below 1100 pixels so the active form keeps usable space.

The Review stage can export an original two-page A4 field dossier as one printable PDF plus two 2480x3508 (300-DPI) PNG pages. Page 1 is the table-ready character record; page 2 contains rules, resolved choices, source references, advances, and campaign notes. The PDF is image-based, so its text is not selectable. Open it in a PDF viewer and print at 100% scale on A4 paper.

“War Grinder” plays as OWCA's looping background soundtrack and continues uninterrupted while changing scenes. Use the landing-page music button or press `M` outside a text field to pause or resume it. The default level is deliberately lower than full volume.

## Acceptance example
